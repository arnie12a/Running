This was my final run in Mexico City. I was trying to run two miles but my lungs were feeling heavy because of the altitude. I ran through the really pretty park in Condesa. The running community at this park is rally inspiring as well which makes me really excited for when I return. I think the next time I am in Mexico City will be when I come for a week and work remote and go for runs in the morning and evening.
