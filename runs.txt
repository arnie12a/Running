Activity Type
The type of workout performed (for example: running, cycling, hiking, or swimming).

Date
The calendar date on which the activity took place.

Favorite
Indicates whether the activity was marked as a favorite by the user.

Title
The custom or system-generated name given to the activity.

Distance
Total distance covered during the activity (usually miles or kilometers).

Calories
Estimated number of calories burned during the activity.

Time
Total recorded duration of the activity.

Avg HR (Average Heart Rate)
The average heart rate throughout the activity, measured in beats per minute (bpm).

Max HR (Maximum Heart Rate)
The highest heart rate recorded during the activity.

Aerobic TE (Aerobic Training Effect)
A score (typically from 0.0 to 5.0) estimating how much the activity improved aerobic fitness.

Avg Run Cadence
Average number of steps taken per minute while running.

Max Run Cadence
Highest number of steps per minute recorded during the run.

Avg Pace
Average time taken to cover one unit of distance (for example, minutes per mile or kilometer).

Best Pace
Fastest pace achieved over any segment of the activity.

Total Ascent
Total elevation gained during the activity.

Total Descent
Total elevation lost during the activity.

Avg Stride Length
Average distance covered per step during the activity.

Avg Vertical Ratio
The ratio of vertical movement to forward movement while running, often used as a running efficiency metric.

Avg Vertical Oscillation
Average amount of vertical bounce per stride while running.

Avg Ground Contact Time
Average time each foot stays in contact with the ground per step, measured in milliseconds.

Avg GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace)
Pace adjusted to account for elevation changes, reflecting the effort as if the terrain were flat.

Normalized Power (NP)
A weighted power metric that accounts for changes in intensity, providing a better estimate of true effort than simple average power.

Training Stress Score (TSS)
A composite score that measures workout intensity and duration to estimate overall training load.

Avg Power
Average power output during the activity, typically measured in watts.

Max Power
Highest recorded power output during the activity.

Steps
Total number of steps taken during the activity.

Body Battery Drain
Estimated reduction in the body’s energy reserves due to the activity.

Min Temp
Lowest recorded ambient temperature during the activity.

Decompression
A recovery-related metric that estimates how much rest may be needed after the activity, depending on the device ecosystem.

Best Lap Time
Fastest time recorded for a single lap during the activity.

Number of Laps
Total number of laps recorded in the activity.

Max Temp
Highest recorded ambient temperature during the activity.

Moving Time
Total time during which movement was detected (pauses and stops are excluded).

Elapsed Time
Total clock time from the start to the end of the activity, including pauses.

Min Elevation
Lowest elevation reached during the activity.

Max Elevation
Highest elevation reached during the activity.
