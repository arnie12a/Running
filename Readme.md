📊 Activity / Metadata Fields
Activity Type
The kind of workout or activity performed (e.g., run, bike, hike, swim).
Date
The calendar date when the activity occurred.
Favorite
A flag indicating whether the activity was marked as a “favorite” by the user.
Title
The user-assigned or system-generated name of the activity.
🏃 Distance & Pace
Distance
Total distance traveled during the activity (usually in miles or kilometers).
Avg Pace
The average time it took to cover one unit of distance (e.g., minutes per mile/km).
Best Pace
The fastest pace achieved during the activity (e.g., the quickest mile/km).

⚡ Effort & Performance Metrics
Time
The total elapsed time recorded for the activity.
Moving Time
Time during which movement was detected (excludes stops/pauses).
Elapsed Time
Total clock time from start to finish (includes pauses).

❤️ Heart Rate Metrics
Avg HR (Average Heart Rate)
The mean heart rate across the activity (beats per minute).
Max HR (Maximum Heart Rate)
The highest heart rate recorded during the activity.

🧠 Training Metrics
Aerobic TE (Aerobic Training Effect)
Estimate of how much the activity improved aerobic fitness on a scale (usually 0–5).
Training Stress Score® (TSS®)
A measure of workout stress based on intensity and duration (higher = more stress).
Decompression
Estimate of recovery needed post-activity (often based on stress and heart rate).

💥 Power Metrics (cycling / running with power sensors)
Normalized Power® (NP®)
A weighted average power metric that accounts for intensity changes better than simple average.
Avg Power
Average output power (watts) over the activity.
Max Power
Highest recorded power output (watts) in the activity.

🦵 Cadence & Stride
Avg Run Cadence
Average steps per minute during a run.
Max Run Cadence
Highest cadence recorded.
Avg Stride Length
Average distance covered per step (usually in meters).

📏 Vertical Metrics
Total Ascent
Total elevation gained during the activity (sum of all upward movement).
Total Descent
Total elevation loss (sum of downward movement).
Avg Vertical Ratio
Ratio of vertical movement to horizontal distance (how “steep” the activity was).
Avg Vertical Oscillation
Average vertical motion per stride (how much you bounce up/down).
⏱ Ground Contact & Efficiency
Avg Ground Contact Time
Average time each foot spends on the ground per step (milliseconds).
Avg GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace)
Adjusted pace based on grade/elevation to normalize effort (e.g., uphill vs flat).

🥾 Steps & Body Metrics
Steps
Total steps taken during the activity.
Body Battery Drain
Estimated reduction in the body’s recovery/energy reserve from the activity.
🌡 Temperature

Min Temp
Lowest ambient temperature during the activity.
Max Temp
Highest ambient temperature occurred.

🏁 Lap Metrics
Best Lap Time
Fastest recorded lap split in the activity.
Number of Laps
How many laps were completed (if applicable).

🏔 Elevation
Min Elevation
Lowest elevation point reached.
Max Elevation
Highest elevation point reached.
